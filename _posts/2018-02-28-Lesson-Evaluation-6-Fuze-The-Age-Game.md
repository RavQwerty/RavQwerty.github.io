    <td>As always copying the correct script from the booklet was extremely helpful, however, it was also important to make small changes that I felt were more appropriate to the theme of the game. I made a game where the answers were quite satirical therefore I had to change some of the answers to suit it. Also I used previous coding knowledge to change the colour of the paper and ink to make the game look neater.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>When I moved onto the coding of the lights I wasn't sure where to start so I immediately asked someone who did understand the code how to help. Although there wasn’t much time left, I didn’t really think for myself so I didn’t properly learn anything. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will constantly remember to add in things that I have learned from previous lessons to make the end product look cleaner. This will also help to cement prior knowledge in a way that is useful to the current coding. In the future, even if there is little time left I will always try to work out what I am trying to do by myself before asking for help.</td>
