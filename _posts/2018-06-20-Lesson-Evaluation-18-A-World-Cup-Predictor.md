    <td>When brainstorming ideas as to how to create the program, it was helpful to essentially think like a betting company: what data would we need to use to? One of the most useful things we did as a group was class brainstorming, this allowed us to think of better and better ways to make our program.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Sometimes we would get a little distracted when discussing what data we needed to use; we ended up talking about the football, not the code! Although we thought of lots of good data to use to create our program, we ended up thinking of too many data points and made our task more and more complicated. When writing my simplified version of a World Cup predictor, I wrote too much code before debugging it, this meant that I spent a lot of time changing things.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Although we probably won't have a lesson like this again, it will be important to remember to use brainstorming as an effective technique to create great ideas. Without our brainstorming session we would have had only half the ideas to create our program. It will be useful to know our limitations because today we overcomplicated our original idea and made the World Cup Predictor impossible to create.</td>
