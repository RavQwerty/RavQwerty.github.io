    <td>It was very effective to essentially mess around with the robotic arm as we learnt so much about the different functions. We learnt which commands were necessary to perform a certain action. For example, my challenge was to grip somebody else's tie and then lift them up. This helped test my understanding of the robotic arm. Also, when we wrote some long code we had an efficient method of checking if our copying was correct. One person would type, another would read it out to them and the final person would check if the written code was right.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We spent a bit too long trying to work out why the monitor wasn’t turning on before finally concluding that it had nothing to do with the Fuze products and all to do with the monitor itself. We probably spent a little too much time experimenting with the arm, this meant that we had less time to effectively troubleshoot the code we had written. The consequence was that we didn’t have enough time to finish it before the end of the lesson.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will remember to use the time more effectively to complete more of the work and further our understanding of general coding. However, it was useful to work in a more jovial, relaxed manner as this allowed us to get to grips with the robot arm in a much better way. We were learning without really knowing that we were!</td>
