    <td>When encountering problems in this lesson I persevered and continued to try different possibilities to find the correct method on my own. This was something I highlighted that I needed to improve on from a previous blog and in that time I have improved my resilience. When other people asked me for help I gave answers that were more helpful but didn't give the whole solution to the problem.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>At points I forgot some of the things I had learned from previous lessons - this prevented me from learning as much as possible. This probably occurred because generally I do the 30 minutes homework in one large session rather than in small sessions. Sometimes I made the code quite long and convoluted: this wasted time.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>In the future I will try to do 10 minutes of Python on Codecademy on 3 days rather than 30 minutes of Codecademy on one day. This will definitely help reinforce my coding knowledge. In the future I will need to condense the code script into smaller, but more efficient groupings. This will better my understanding and save time.</td>
