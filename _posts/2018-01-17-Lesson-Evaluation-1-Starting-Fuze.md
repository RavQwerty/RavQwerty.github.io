    <td>Carefully consulting the booklet to find the correct code helped Daniel and I to move on quickly. Also using the photos helped as they were very instructive. Remembering how to set up from last week helped us to start our Fuze program quickly. Also thinking about my previous coding knowledge from Scratch helped understand problems we faced. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>We got a bit distracted by other people messing about near us. Also we didn't manage our space very well and ended up with our work area being cramped and overcrowded. The new keyboard of the Fuze box was quite hard to use so I need to use it more to get to use it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Continuing to think methodically will definitely help solve further problems. Setting up the Fuze Box quickly will definitely be important in the future when we donâ€™t have much time to work on our projects. In the future I need to remember to ignore silly people near me. Next time I will move all unnecessary objects off the table and somewhere else.</td>
