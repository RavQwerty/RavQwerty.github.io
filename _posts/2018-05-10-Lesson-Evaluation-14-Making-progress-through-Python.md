    <td>One technique I used very effectively was following the grammar and wording of the instructions to create some basic code for one specific script. The wording was important as it often gave a clue as to where to place different functions. This helped me tackle the longest scripts and further my coding knowledge.      </td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Often I was led astray by the grey-boxed code as I knew it always had to be in our script but on some levels the grey-boxed code was unnecessary to complete the instructions. Sometimes I was wasting time trying to fit the code into my script when my current version was actually correct! I should always run my code at different times to see what I need to do next.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In the future I will recall this lesson and remember to always test my code whenever I think it may be right. Also, I should remind myself that the grey-boxed code is not always mandatory to the script, some of it can be switched out for other things. This will help me realise that there are usually several ways of following the instructions, not just one.</td>
