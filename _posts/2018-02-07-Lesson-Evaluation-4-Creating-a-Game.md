(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>Yes, we created the standard game on Fuze and began to think of our own game ideas.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>By carefully copying out the original Fuze game we were able to begin to understand how to create our own games and also how to incorporate other elements of Fuze that we had learnt over the weeks. For example, I remembered how to correctly use the "print" command to create the text for the game. Also, we managed our time well, one of us working on the code and one on the blog.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sometimes we were just copying off the book and not really thinking what it meant. This means we didn't actually learn as much as we could have done. The only problem with one of us doing the work and the other working on their Github meant that we didnâ€™t always understand what our partner had done in their time on the Fuze.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In the future we must make sure we know what code we are putting before we do. This will definitely mean we learn more and understand different types of code. As always, recalling commands we have used previously will be useful. Next time we will make sure to fill each other in on what we have done on the Fuze so we can both understand how to make different parts of the game.</td>
