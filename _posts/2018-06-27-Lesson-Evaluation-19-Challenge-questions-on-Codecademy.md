    <td>The exercise I was working through today was very difficult and we were given little instruction on how to correctly complete it therefore I had to use all my coding knowledge and a bit of ingenuity! Obviously it was important to recall all the functions and rules I have learned over the past few months - this was extremely helpful. Also, reading between the lines of the instructions allowed me to work out what functions I would need to use.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Often my thinking was too rigid; I wasn't thinking laterally enough and this meant my code was way off the necessary script. Sometimes I would give up too easily and use the solution button to move onto the next exercise. This was not the right attitude and I should not have taken the easiest option.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In the future I must think outside the box for new ways to meet the instructions. This will also apply to all other aspects of life, especially all my other subjects within school. I must continue to persevere as giving up is definitely not the right option, although it may be the easiest.</td>
