    <td>Once again, using the example helped me create the correct code when otherwise I would have been unsure as to what to do. Furthermore, I saved some time when copying in the grey-boxed code to my script. This allowed me to progress with ease through several of the stages. It was extremely effective to recall past knowledge, particularly about lists as they were involved frequently.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sometimes I became quite confused by the initial instructions which would sometimes lead me astray as they did not give much detail as to what to do. However, I needed to look further into the instructions, not just using the explanation.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson I must remember to read all the instructions before trying to decipher them. This is very important for all subjects, not just I.T. It will always be important to remember past information to allow me to progress more efficiently through the exercises. As always, saving time by using the grey-boxed code will be verly helpful.</td>
