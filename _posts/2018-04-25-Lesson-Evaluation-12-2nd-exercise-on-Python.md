  <tr>
    <td>The most useful tool I used to help my progress was that of recall: remembering the previous exercise's rules and specific commands. Also, when struggling with some logic, it was very effective to step away from the code and think of the possible answer through common English. This certainly helped solve certain issues. My understanding of the instructions had definitely improved from to the previous lesson.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sometimes when helping other people I gave too much of the answer; this prevented them from learning as I was doing the "learning" for them. Although it is good to help other people, at points I spent too much time doing other people’s work for them and not improving my own understanding of Python.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In the future I definitely need to improve my aid of others. I should think more carefully about how to give a hint to the solution instead of giving the answer straight away. This will help the other person’s learning much more. Sometimes I should let people figure solutions out for themselves, rather than always relying on me to assist them.</td>
