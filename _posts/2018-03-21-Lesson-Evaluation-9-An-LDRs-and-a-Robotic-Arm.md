    <td>We moved very efficiently through the LDR stage (Light Dependent Resistor) and onto the robotic arm because of our ability to work through problems and effective teamwork. When we started using the LDR we encountered some problems, however we checked the variables that could be affecting our project and ended up with a working LDR. When we used the robotic arm we learnt quickly that the coding names were similar to the names in the human arm.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>When we started with the LDR we skipped over the starting page and this meant we didn't fully understand how to set up the wiring. Fortunately, we saw the necessary code so this didnâ€™t create a large problem. However if we had looked at the first page we would have received a much better general overview of the project.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For the future, it will be important to relate the coding language to common language as this was important to us when manipulating the robotic arm. We used our knowledge of the human arm to work out which piece of code was necessary to move a certain part of the robot. We should always remember to read the introductions to new projects to make sure we understand the general aim. </td>
