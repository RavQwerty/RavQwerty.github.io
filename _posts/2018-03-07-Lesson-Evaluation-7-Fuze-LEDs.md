    <td>It was important to think logically when one of the LEDs didn't light up. When there was a problem like this we treated it like a science issue. We changed the differing variables one at a time to see what was the problem; eventually we worked out that some of the LEDs weren’t working correctly and that some of the wires weren’t connected properly. This allowed us to improve our resilience and remove faulty components! </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Working on the Fuze breadboard was quite fiddly and became quite frustrating reasonably quickly. This was in part due to the way we had set up the breadboard - we had put the LEDs and wires in first, allowing only a tiny space to manoeuver the resistors in. We were too focused on where the wires in the booklet were positioned and we weren’t properly thinking about what would be better suited to our Fuze box. </td>

  <tr>
    <td>When working with the LEDs or any other external Fuze parts it will be important to take a step back if things are getting annoying or irritating to use. Also, it will be important to remember to space the components out and not get cramped into a small area. This will allow us to work more efficiently and tackle problems with greater ease. </td>
