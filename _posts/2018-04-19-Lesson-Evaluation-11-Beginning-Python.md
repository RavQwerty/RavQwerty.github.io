    <td>It was very useful to think logically; this meant that I was trying to condense variables into the shortest possible name that was appropriate. Also it was extremely important to start getting into good habits. For example when using the "print" function it will be useful to put brackets around the speech marks like this: print:(“This is just an example”). I had to use the example code to work out how to complete the instructions successfully.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sometimes, I needed to analyse the instructions more carefully as they were quite convoluted in places. Also, I was often writing out code that was unnecessary; I could've just copied it in to my Python text from the grey boxes. The grey-boxed code always had to be in our code, however sometimes I didn’t take this advice on board as I thought I had my own idea of how to finish the instructions.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will make sure to always be using the correct functions, even if they are not necessary at that specific moment. This will certainly put me one step ahead of everybody else when it comes to harder Python code. In the future I will definitely use the grey-boxed code as this will help save time and progress more quickly. I should always look at the code in the grey boxes as they are essential to the text and give me a better understanding of what to do. </td>
