(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>No, I didn't manage to save my work on to a USB stick and therefore I couldn’t progress forward.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>It was helpful to mentally recall my work from the previous work so I could quickly recreate the first assessment stage. Also it was important to remember how to set up the the Fuze box quickly. When stuck, it was extremely useful to ask for other people's opinions as their thoughts shed fresh light on my conundrums.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I relied too much upon my partner’s I.T. knowledge and struggled as he wasn’t there to help me. I ended up spending too much time trying to save my work so I couldn’t progress forward and do the lessons actual work.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to become more independent so I can continue to work quickly if my partner is absent. This will help me become more self-sufficient and less reliant on other people’s knowledge. Also I need to learn when to move on so I don’t waste our already limited lesson time. In the future I will remember to ask other people for help after I have no ideas myself.</td>
