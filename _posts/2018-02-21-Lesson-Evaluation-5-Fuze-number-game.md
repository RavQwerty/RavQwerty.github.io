    <td>Again, splitting up the work meant that we got even more done by allowing our partner to concentrate fully on copying down the code. Also, this meant that we had more time to improve our Github blogs. Thinking carefully about the specifics in the code allowed us to change the game to make it more challenging or move quicker.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>We weren't as efficient setting up as we could have been so here we wasted a bit of time. The work we were doing ended up having over 80 lines of script and we only tested to see if it would work right at the end. This meant that if there were problems (which there was) they would be much harder to find.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>As always splitting up work will allow us to move swiftly through the booklet - however it is important that we inform our partners of the changes or additions we have made to the script. We need to make sure that in the future we are setting up the Fuze correctly and quickly. We need to regularly check  our work to see that we were on the right track.</td>
