    <td>When we were stuck and unsure how to continue we consulted other pairs that had managed to get their badge working. This allowed us to move past our problems easily and quickly. Working together well was very important - when coding something long or confusing one of our pair read out the useful code and the other actually put it into the Fuze box.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Not reading all the necessary sections before the part we were told to look at hindered our learning as we didn't properly understand how to start creating our own badge. We understood some of what we were supposed to do but not all of it. Also, there was a problem with the plug sharing between our group and another pair meaning we had to keep switching plugs in and out and this slowed down our work.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>In the future I will remember to read all the necessary sections before moving on, even if we arenâ€™t told to. Also we should better manage our workspace, specifically power sources, in the future. We should also remember to work efficiently as a pair by one reading and one coding.</td>
