    <td>It was much more efficient if one of our pair read the script and the other actually coded it into the Fuze box. This was much easier than previous weeks when my partner had been absent. This technique was most useful when somebody accidentally deleted our script which we hadn't saved. Therefore we had to start over, fortunately, it only took a few minutes to return to our original script.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The area we were working in was quite raucous and distracting, this meant we couldn’t work to the best of our abilities. At the end of the lesson when half our lights weren’t flashing up we gave up and didn’t think through the variables that may have been affecting our project. Fortunately, we weren’t stuck in this rut for long and soon tested to see what variable wasn’t working correctly.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Perhaps in the future we should sit in a different area to the one we were sitting in today. This will move us away from annoying and distracting people. Also, we should remember to keep a positive mental attitude and always take a step back from issues before tackling them. This will mean that we will always be on track and moving forwards in one way or another.</td>
