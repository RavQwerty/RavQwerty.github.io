    <td>One of the most important techniques I used was using all the pieces of information to work out what I was trying to do on that exercise. The information I used to solve the exercises were; using the given example, extracting the specifics from the wording of the instructions and occasionally using the hint. It was important to troubleshoot efficiently - I logically changed one possible issue at a time so I could correctly identify where I had gone wrong.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>One slight quibble is that I was not always as efficient as I could be, I was still creating large chunks of code where smaller groupings would have been more effective. The skill of condensing answers into the smallest, yet still correct versions of themselves will be an important thing to learn.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In the future, it will be vital to remember what I did well from this lesson as it affects all parts of life and learning. It will always be important to use all given pieces of information to solve tough problems. In addition, troubleshooting is another significant skill to utilise (specifically in I.T.) as it is another way to solve conundrums. In the future I will need to work more effectively by using less text.</td>
