    <td>Although I did get annoyed at quite a few things in the lesson, I was getting into much better habits which I had highlighted I would need to do from a past blog. Specifically, I was always reading the instructions correctly and was using 'more than' and ‘less than’ commands productively.  </td>

  <tr>
    <td>At points I think I gave up too easily and allowed myself to use the solution. In most cases the solution showed me that I was trying to think too complexly, I should’ve given the simple answer. Also at times I became quite frustrated and my irritation at the code prevented me from thinking logically. I had yet to comprehend that the computer would only accept a few correct versions of the code.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In the future I will not give up so swiftly and will try all the possible combinations I can think of. This will not only be important for I.T. lessons but for other subjects like maths. Being resilient and persevering is one of the most important skills to utilise. I need to realise that sometimes the answer is simple and I don’t need to overcomplicate what I am coding. </td>
