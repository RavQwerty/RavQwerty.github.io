    <td>Something I have definitely improved on from previous I.T. lessons is the ability to use less code; but that still has the same meaning. This also includes using more efficient structures of groups of code. When beginning the lesson I remembered much more from previous exercises because I used my homework time more effectively. I had done 5 minutes of Codecademy on 6 days rather than 30 minutes on one day.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>When I become stuck in lessons, it will be useful to utilise a new technique I have just thought of. This new technique is to consult previous blogs to remind myself of what I need to do to improve. Furthermore, I could ask myself: "Have I altered that habit?" and “Have I experienced that issue again?”</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It will be vital to continue to spread out my Codecademy at home as this will ensure I reinforce specific topics and be able to remember much more. This technique will also be useful when tackling other, long assignments. Looking back at previous work (in this case blogs) will be an important tool to improve my learning amongst a variety of fields. This obviously holds importance in I.T. because I have a diary of what I have done well/badly in each lesson - my blogs.</td>
